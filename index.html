<h1>Fixing my old Corsair SP2500 speakes</h1>
<p>After many years with my SP2500 speakers, one day the stopped working. First the sound was very low eventhough I maxed it and second they completely stopped working, with only the remonte
  lighting. After a lot of googling I found out that the power supply inside the subwoofer was of inferior quality. Some people manage to replace with with sucess, and I 
  decided to do the same. I bought a RT-50D Mean Well power supply which can output 5/12/24 V and up to 1 amp. Based on what I read online this supply is too weak. However, I took the whole
  system to the electronic lab and measured the amount of current used. In average I got around 0.5 amp with some peaks between 0.8-1 amp. Therefore, I decided to try with
  the RT-50D anyway. After following this link for the cable connections https://forums.overclockers.com.au/threads/notes-on-replacing-a-corsair-sp2500-psu.1181084/ I got
  the speakers up and running just like new! Hopefully this will help others too!</p>
